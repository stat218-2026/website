## Meet Your Instructor

Life science is complicated. As your professor, I know you already know this, and it's not my intention to teach you that. However, I am committed to giving you a glimpse into some of these complexities by integrating statistical concepts into life science topics. By the end of this course, I hope to increase your statistical literacy and data literacy. In the best-case scenario, I will support you in decision- making process and making sense of uncertainty in the (1) behavior of chemicals, (2) relationships among living organisms & communities of living organisms, (3) physical processes that sustain most of the living systems and (4) dynamics of human health, through the use of statistics.

STAT 218 is tailored for life science students who will inevitably engage with Statistics in their future professions.
